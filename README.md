## 👋Hi, I'm Mindy 

I work at the intersection of market research, data, and technology. I am a market research nerd - a data practitioner - a solopreneur. 
😅 Fun fact: I’m Vietnamese — **Mindy** is my preferred name (as in “**Mind Y?**”). 🧩These days, I’m focused on translating customer and market data into practical systems, tools, and insights that help businesses make better decisions. I have 10+ years of experience across market research, business intelligence, customer experience, and growth strategy, mostly working with financial institutions, digital platforms, and consulting companies. 

  🔭 **What I’m working on**

    + market & customer insights
    + POVs on customer intelligence, digital growth and strategy 

  🌱 **What I’m learning**

  - AI & automation for building, coding, and storytelling
  - How to turn insights into scalable systems
